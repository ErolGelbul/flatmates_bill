<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Description

An app that outputs the amount of payment needed per tenant, according to the days each person
has spent in the house. There are 2 projects in this repository. `flatmates_bill_pdf` directory
outputs a pdf file after inputting aforementioned values. The second one, the larger project,
is a web application, built using Flask.

This is my first Flask project and my goal was to have situations where I use python code
to communicate with the front end. Anywhere, where I used the {{}} means this communication
is taking place.

I used Flask's MethodView class from its MVC architecture (in this case MethodView is the View part).
I wanted to use both of the methods this class provides, get and post. I used `get` to input user
information to the back end and manipulate this data to later display the results by connecting
a button widget to the `post` method.

P.S. The cover image makes it evident that I am hilarious.

To run the web application:

1. Download the files.
2. Run main.py on your `development server`.
